# gigglygiraffe

Section One:
  My project is just a basic informational site, the subject content of the page is predominantly giraffe related with a few extra links connected to related webpages(Giraffe Conservation Foundation, American Wildlife Foundation and SeaWorld!).  I intended for this site to be fun, simple and easy to navigate for the user.  I also developed this site with everyone in mind...including families! The link named Kids Zoo is exactly that, a cyber zoo for kids! Complete with pictures, videos and tons of fun facts.  Overall I enjoyed this experience and I'm please with the website I created.  I received tons of information, which was then applied to a hands on requirement, I enjoyed every minute  and  I can't wait dive deeper into field of Software Development.
